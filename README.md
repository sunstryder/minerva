### Minerva is an owl

Minerva can answer questions about DnD 5e skills and spells (From the SRD) through Slack slash commands!

In the future she will learn how to answer other types of questions as well :)

Minerva relies on the DnD 5th Edition API http://www.dnd5eapi.co/ made by Adrian Padua https://github.com/adrpadua

Example use:

/spells acid arrow

- Returns description and usage for the Acid Arrow spell.

/skills acrobatics

- Returns information on what situations are governed by the acrobatics skill
